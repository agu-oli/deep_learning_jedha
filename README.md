# Jedha's deep learning module deliverable

## In this folder you will find the project deliverable for completing Jedha's module on Deep Learning

### The notebook includes the training of more than one Deep Learning model for a email spam detector and the correspoding performance analysis : simple dense layers, RNN layers, GRU, LSTM, all these models with an embedding layer. Finally we test applying embedding through Fasttext and then a simple dense layers model.

### The target variable is not balanced. For each model results, loss values, accuracy scores and classification report including F1 score are included.
